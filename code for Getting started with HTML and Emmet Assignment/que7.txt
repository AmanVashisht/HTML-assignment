7. Explain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet.

Answer:
Nesting operators in Emmet are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree. They are used to define the relationship between elements in the generated code.


There are four nesting operators in Emmet:

> (Child): This operator is used to nest elements inside each other. 
For example, the abbreviation div>ul>li will generate an HTML div element with an ul element inside, which in turn contains a li element.


+ (Sibling): This operator is used to place elements near each other, on the same level. 
For example, the abbreviation div+p+bq will generate an HTML div element, a p element, and a bq element, all on the same level.


^ (Climb-up): This operator is used to climb one level up the generated tree and place the element in that position. 
For example, the abbreviation div+div>p>span+em^ will generate an HTML div element, a div element, a p element, a span element, and an em element, with the em element placed one level up from the span element.


() (Grouping): This operator is used to group subtrees in complex abbreviations.
For example, the abbreviation (div>ul>li)+(div>p+bq) will generate an HTML div element with two subtrees: the first subtree is an ul element with a li element inside, and the second subtree is a div element with a p element and a bq element inside

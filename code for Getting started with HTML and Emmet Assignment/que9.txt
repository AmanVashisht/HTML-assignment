9. What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags.

Answer:
Self-closing tags are HTML tags that do not need to be closed manually by their closing tag. This means that they do not have a separate closing tag as </tag>

Some self-closing tags are:

<br>: This tag inserts a line break.
<hr>: This tag inserts a horizontal rule.
<img>: This tag inserts an image.
<input>: This tag inserts an input field.

Meta tags are a special type of HTML tag that is used to provide information about a web page. They are always placed in the <head> section of a web page.

Meta tags do not have any content, and they are always self-closing tags. Some common meta tags include:

<meta charset="UTF-8">: This tag specifies the character encoding of the web page.
<meta name="description" content="This is a brief description of the web page.">: This tag provides a brief description of the web page.
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: This tag provides a list of keywords that describe the web page.

    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>Comments are programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. The syntax of comments in various programming languages varies considerably.comments are lines of code that are written to provide explanations, documentation, or annotations within the source code. Comments are not executed by the computer or interpreted as part of the program's logic; instead, they are intended for human readers, including other programmers or the original author, to understand the code better.</p>
